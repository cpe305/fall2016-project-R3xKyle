# Sudoku
### fall2016-project-R3xKyle

All solutions are randomly generated and each puzzle only has one solution.

Design Patterns:
* Observer Pattern:
   * Using the observer pattern made it easy to update the GUI when any of the Sudoku Options buttons were clicked.
* State Pattern:
   * Using the state pattern made my project much more modular. Allows for easy addition of new states to support additional difficulties.
